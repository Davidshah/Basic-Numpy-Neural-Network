# Basic Numpy Neural Network

### Introduction
In this project, we build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. Completed as part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101).

### The Problem
Imagine we run a bike sharing business and want to estimate the amount of bikes we will need on any given day to meet demand. Using the given dataset, can we build a model that accomplished this?

### Getting Started
* Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` installed.
* Run the notebook `jupyter notebook numpy-neural-network.ipynb`

#### Data
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
